# pandas_challenge

We are given the district-wide standardized test results. This means we have
access to every student's math and reading results, in addition to information on the schools
they attended. Our task was to aggregate the data to showcase any obvious trends in school performace.
This allowed us to understand whether factors like school size, spending budget per students and school type
had an impact on academic performance metrics. The project was gave us an oppurtunity to manipulate pandas
dataframes to analyze school and standardized test data.
